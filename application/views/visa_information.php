            Students without British or EU/EEA citizenship must apply for a Tier 4 Visa to study in the UK. You can apply for this up to three months before you intend to travel.

            You are required to provide original certificates of qualifications listed on your confirmation of acceptance. You must also be able to demonstrate that you can support both living costs and tuition fees.

            Students from some countries are required to submit certain medical test results.

            You may be asked by the UK Border Force to prove your English proficiency via video interview or a telephone call.

            Note that you will be subject to biometric enrolment on arrival in the UK, consisting of having your photograph and fingerprints taken.

            The visa cost is Â£328 per person.

            To find our more information, or to apply for your visa, visit the UK government website here.
